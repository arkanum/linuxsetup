# Linux Setup Script
A short script to set up a linux distro how I like it

## Installation
Clone the repo to a folder on the new machine. Then run `newmachinesetup.sh`. All of the dotfiles that will be installed are in the dotfiles folder.


## TODO
  - Add shebangs to all shell files
  - gtk2-engines-murrine
